 *  file to read, no local command to run, and no ACP request that returns it. So
 *  a daemon that forgot it on exit would show nothing at all until the review's
 *  next turn, which is most of the time a reviewer spends looking at the screen.
 *
 *  Remembering it is what makes the line permanent. It is written where the
 *  agents are written down rather than on the review, because the limit belongs
 *  to the account: every review on this machine is spending the same allowance,
 *  and the second one should not start blank.
 *
 *  Kept per agent command, since what an agent reports is its own vendor's
 *  figure, and dropped once the window it describes has rolled over - a spent
 *  percentage from a window that has since reset is not stale, it is wrong. */

 *  measured at ~1.5s. It is also the only way in. The CLI's rate-limit figure

 *  rest - nothing about usage), `system init` does not carry it, no file on disk
 *  holds it, and `/status` is refused in print mode.

 *  would mean a review that has not taken a turn yet shows a bare percentage,
 *  which is the half of the answer nobody asked for.
 *
 *  This is also the only place the per-model weekly lines exist: the pushed bag
 *  names the account's two windows and stops there. They are read as what they
 *  are - one model's share, labelled with the model - rather than folded into the
 *  account's figure, which would be a wrong number shown confidently.
 *
 *  Wording drift costs a figure, not a crash: nothing matches, nothing is
