/** One question to a codex app-server, and nothing else.
 *
 *  Codex keeps things ezdesign wants - the account's rate limits, the names it has
 *  given past conversations - and exposes none of them over ACP: `codex-acp`
 *  receives them and drops them. They are all one JSON-RPC call away on its
 *  app-server, which costs no model turn, so this stands one up for a second and
 *  asks.
 *
 *  A server of its own rather than the one the running agent is talking to: there
 *  is no way in to that one, and a second one is cheap - measured under a second,
 *  end to end. */
