/** The MCP server the agent sends variants back through.
 *
 *  ezdesign is the ACP *client*, so the ordinary way to give an agent a tool -
 *  be an MCP server it connects to - is not open to it: a client has no way to
 *  hand tools down the ACP connection. ACP's own answer to that is the
 *  `mcp-over-acp` RFD (`mcp/connect`, `mcp/message`, a `type: "acp"` server),
 *  whose types ship in SDK 1.4.0 marked UNSTABLE, and which neither agent
 *  implements yet: probed 2026-09-15, `claude-agent-acp` 0.77.0 advertises
 *  `mcpCapabilities: { http, sse }` and `codex-acp` 1.11.0 answers `acp: false`.
 *  So the tool is served over HTTP, on the session's own Express app, and the
 *  url goes to the agent in `mcpServers`. When `acp` arrives this is the piece
 *  that moves; the tool and everything behind it do not.
 *
 *  ## One server per round
 *
 *  Each explore round gets its own url and its own token. Attribution is then
 *  the daemon's rather than the agent's: a call on round A's url cannot land in
 *  round B however confused the agent gets about which explore it is answering,
 *  and a call on a round that is over is refused with a reason instead of
 *  appearing in a strip the user has closed. It also means the tool takes no
 *  round id, which is one fewer thing for the agent to copy wrong.
 *
 *  The token is not decoration. Binding to loopback is not authentication -
 *  every process on this machine can reach the port - and this tool puts markup
 *  on the page the user is reviewing.
 *
 *  ## Nothing here waits for the user
 *
 *  `explore_variant` returns as soon as the variant is recorded. MCP clients
 *  time out a tool call, and the escape hatch for a long one - resetting the
 *  timeout on `notifications/progress` - is the *client's* to opt into, which
 *  several current ones do not. Anything that needs the user's answer goes
 *  through ACP elicitation, which is built to block; this channel is for the
 *  agent handing something over and carrying on. */
