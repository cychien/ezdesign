/** Client-side route changes, which nothing announces on its own - and, inside a
 *  preview, the history entries they would otherwise leave behind.
 *
 *  A document navigation re-runs this whole script and reports through
 *  `ez:ready`. An SPA moving between pages does neither: the shell would go on
 *  believing the preview sits on the page the session was opened on - so the
 *  other previews are never brought along, and a reload takes the user back to
 *  a page they left long ago.
 *
 *  History is patched rather than polled because the route change *is* the
 *  history call; there is no other moment to read, and a DOM mutation is a
 *  consequence of the route change rather than the thing itself. Both methods
 *  keep their own `this`: this document belongs to the app, and the overlay is
 *  only listening in on it.
 *
 *  Framed, a `pushState` is carried out as a `replaceState`. The route change
 *  itself is untouched - the app transitions exactly as it meant to - but the
 *  entry does not stay here, because an entry written inside a preview is one
 *  only that preview can answer for, and the shell throws its previews away
 *  every time the stage is rebuilt. The shell pushes one of its own the moment
 *  it hears the report; `nav.ts` has the whole story. Un-framed there is no
 *  shell to hand it to, so the app keeps its history as it wrote it. */
