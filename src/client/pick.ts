/** The pick transaction, as a reducer.
 *
 *  A pick outlives the document that started it: the user goes off to point at
 *  something, and the page they were composing on may be replaced on the way.
 *  Only the shell survives that, so only the shell can hold the state - and the
 *  state is worth holding carefully, because the failure mode is not a wrong
 *  pixel. `attachify.discard()` deletes uploaded files, so a transition that
 *  drops a composer the user is still writing in takes their screenshots with
 *  it.
 *
 *  Written as a pure function of (state, event) so that the abort paths, the
 *  stale-id races and the re-arm-after-navigation replay can be tested at all:
 *  the shell's tests have no DOM. */
