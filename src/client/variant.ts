/** Standing an agent's variant in a live element's place, and finding that place
 *  again every time the app rebuilds it.
 *
 *  Four decisions carry this file.
 *
 *  **The original is hidden, never removed.** A host is inserted as its next
 *  sibling and the original gets `data-ez-swapped`, which a rule takes out of
 *  layout. Replacing the node would break the app: React's reconciler asserts on
 *  the nodes it created, and the next update that touches a replaced one throws.
 *  A foreign *sibling* it tolerates, because it positions its own children
 *  relative to its own children. Taking the original out of layout rather than
 *  merely hiding it is what lets the variant have its flex or grid slot, which is
 *  most of what a layout review is looking at.
 *
 *  **The variant lives in a shadow root, and the host is `display: contents`.**
 *  Isolation both ways is the shadow boundary's to give, not a selector rewrite's:
 *  the page's rules cannot reach the variant, the variant's `<style>` cannot
 *  reach the page, and `@media` and `@keyframes` just work. What does cross the
 *  boundary is exactly what a variant of *this* page should get - inherited
 *  typography and colour, and the page's CSS custom properties - so it looks
 *  native without being subject to `.cta-row a { ... }`. The host itself has no
 *  box: `display: contents` hands its slot to the variant, so the flex or grid
 *  item is the agent's markup, not a wrapper around it. The earlier rewrite is
 *  gone with the bug it had - a rule for the variant's own root class was
 *  rewritten to a descendant selector and never matched it again, which is what
 *  "the base styles are missing" looked like.
 *
 *  **The element is found again, not held onto.** A popover is the general case,
 *  not a special one: React re-renders, HMR remounts, the user navigates away and
 *  back. An element reference survives none of that; the anchor does. So a
 *  `MutationObserver` re-runs the search whenever nodes arrive and re-applies the
 *  selection to a fresh match. That is what makes "close the dialog, open it
 *  again, the variant is still there" true, and with the build plugin it is
 *  exact: the same JSX has the same `file:line` on every mount.
 *
 *  **The search is pure.** `locate` scores serialised candidates rather than
 *  elements, so the rules that decide which of three identical cards the user
 *  meant can be tested without a DOM - which the test suite does not have. */
