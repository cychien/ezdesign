/** One ACP session's messages, in the order the agent wrote them.
 *
 *  The SDK has this already, as `ActiveSession` - but only for a session it
 *  created itself: `buildSession(...).start()` wraps `session/new`, and the
 *  `attachSession` that does the wrapping is private. A session reached any other
 *  way - `session/resume` after a daemon restart, a fork - has no wrapper, and
 *  once resume is the common path it cannot be the one without a queue.
 *
 *  So this is that wrapper, for any session id however it was obtained, and it is
 *  the only one: `session/new` goes through it too. Two implementations of an
 *  ordering guarantee would drift, and the one that drifted would say so by
 *  losing a reply about one turn in ten.
 *
 *  ## The ordering guarantee
 *
 *  A turn's streamed chunks arrive as `session/update` notifications; the turn's
 *  end is the `session/prompt` *response*. Those are two independent microtask
 *  chains, so a reader awaiting them separately can see the response first and
 *  end the turn before the words it was made of have arrived.
 *
 *  One queue fed by both fixes it, and the reason it works is the order the two
 *  are put in. The SDK dispatches each inbound message as it reads it, so a
 *  notification is enqueued while the stream is being read; the stop is enqueued
 *  in a `.then()` on the prompt response, which is a continuation of the read
 *  that delivered it. Anything that arrived before the response on the wire is
 *  therefore already in the queue when the stop goes in.
 *
 *  The rule that keeps it true: `route` must not defer past the turn the
 *  notification was read in. Enqueueing synchronously is how it does that here.
 *  A microtask would in fact survive - the stop's own `.then()` is one too, and
 *  queues behind the ones already scheduled - but a timer, an I/O wait, or
 *  anything else that reaches a later macrotask puts the stop in first and loses
 *  the tail of the reply. The chunk-ordering test catches that; it does not catch
 *  the microtask case, which is why the rule is written as "synchronous" rather
 *  than left to whatever the tests happen to notice.
 *
 *  A steer is the same problem in the middle of a turn: where the reply to what
 *  the agent was on ends and the reply to the steered message begins is the
 *  steer's response, and it goes into the queue the way the stop does. */
