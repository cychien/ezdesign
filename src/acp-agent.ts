/** SPIKE: drive a coding agent over ACP so the review never leaves the shell.
 *
 *  The CLI loop makes the agent the only active party: the shell sees whatever
 *  the agent chooses to post, and everything else - streaming output, questions,
 *  permission prompts - stays in the terminal. ACP inverts that: the daemon is
 *  the *client*, the agent a child process speaking JSON-RPC on stdio, and the
 *  protocol guarantees the stream (`session/update`) and routes the questions
 *  (`session/request_permission`) here, whatever the agent is.
 *
 *  One session at a time, one turn at a time, feed capped - a spike's ambitions.
 *  "One session at a time" rather than "one session": `/new` throws the agent's
 *  context away by replacing the ACP session under a connection that stays up,
 *  which is the only way to stop paying for a history the review has moved past. */
